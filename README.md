# deno-parser

This is a fork of [bread-n-butter](https://github.com/wavebeem/bread-n-butter),
a parser combinator library for JavaScript and TypeScript.

In this repository, I aim at:

- making it work with Deno
- reducing the bundle size
- (in future) parsing binary data

bread-n-butter (bnb) is a parser combinator library for JavaScript and
TypeScript.

bnb is semver v0, but unlikely to change much. It should be a stable platform
for development.

Eventually bnb's concepts will become
